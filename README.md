# 🛍️ tuistore

**The TUI app store — find, search, and one-key-install hundreds of terminal apps, without leaving the terminal.**

Browse a curated catalog of TUIs, read the details, and install with a single
key — tuistore figures out *how* to install each one on **your** machine
(cargo, brew, pacman, uv, go, docker…) so you never paste a command your box
can't run. Star the ones you love straight to GitHub.

## what it is

Finding good terminal apps means trawling GitHub and awesome-lists; installing
them means guessing whether it's `cargo install`, `brew install`, `pacman -S`,
`uv tool install`, a `curl | sh` script, or building from source — and half the
commands in a README are for the *wrong* OS.

tuistore fixes both. It's a fast, mouse-and-keyboard TUI that:

- puts **670+ curated TUIs** one fuzzy-search away,
- shows you the **install commands that actually work on your machine**, ranked,
- installs them with **one key** and streams the output live,
- and lets you **★ star** anything you like on GitHub, from the store.

## install

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Gheat1/tuistore   # recommended
# or
pipx install git+https://github.com/Gheat1/tuistore
```

Then just run:

```sh
tuistore
```

<sub>Starring uses the [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com) if you have it
(`gh auth login`); everything else works without it. tuistore itself installs
nothing but itself — it drives the package managers you already have.</sub>

## use it

Dead simple: **type to search, arrow to browse, `i` to install.**

```
 /            focus search — type a name, description, or language
 ↑ ↓ · j k    move through the list        g / G   jump to top / bottom
 enter        open / focus a tool
 i            install  (press a to pick a different method)
 s            star / unstar on GitHub
 o            open the repo in your browser
 f            features / about            t       cycle theme
 ?            all keybindings             q       quit
```

Everything clicks, too — rows, the hint bar, and the draggable pane dividers.

## how the install engine works

This is the hard part, and it's the point of tuistore.

1. **It reads your machine.** OS, Linux distro *family* (Arch, Debian, Fedora,
   SUSE, Void, Alpine, Gentoo…), CPU arch, and every package manager /
   toolchain actually on your `PATH`.
2. **Every tool carries platform-gated install methods.** A method knows what
   binaries it needs and where it's allowed to run, so `pacman -S` only appears
   on Arch, `brew` only where brew exists, `cargo` only where cargo is.
3. **Methods come from three places, most-trusted first:**
   - **official** — commands the project itself documents (hand-verified for the
     featured suite),
   - **from README** — scraped straight out of each repo's README (kept only
     when the command actually names the tool, so dependency lines don't leak),
   - **inferred** — a best-guess from the repo's primary language, always
     labelled as a guess.
4. **It ranks what's runnable** and offers the winner as the default — a clean
   managed install (brew / cargo / uv) before a `curl | sh`, verified before
   guessed — with every alternative one keypress (`a`) away.
5. **It runs it in your login shell** and streams the output live, so it behaves
   exactly like your normal terminal.

If nothing is known yet, tuistore scrapes the README the moment you open the
tool (and caches it), or points you to the docs. Nothing is ever silently run —
you always see the exact command and confirm it.

## the catalog

- **★ Featured — the suite.** [ltui](https://github.com/runpantheon/ltui),
  [jtui](https://github.com/Gheat1/jtui), [sctui](https://github.com/Gheat1/sctui),
  [NaviTui](https://github.com/Gheat1/NaviTui), [opentab](https://github.com/Gheat1/opentab),
  and [ricekit](https://github.com/Gheat1/ricekit) — pinned to the top.
- **670+ tools** from [rothgar/awesome-tuis](https://github.com/rothgar/awesome-tuis),
  grouped into 13 browsable categories, each enriched with live GitHub stars,
  language, and freshness.

Refresh or grow the catalog any time — it's a single re-runnable script:

```sh
uv run python tools/build_catalog.py            # refresh stars + installs
uv run python tools/build_catalog.py --scrape 300   # scrape more READMEs
```

It parses awesome-tuis, batches a GraphQL sweep for stars/language/freshness,
scrapes install commands for the most-starred tools, and infers the rest.

## built on ricekit

tuistore is part of a family. It's built on
[**🍚 ricekit**](https://github.com/Gheat1/ricekit) — the themes, widgets,
modals, icons, and design doctrine behind the whole suite — so it shares the
five themes (`mocha` · `void` · `onyx` · `clear` · `system`), the vim-and-mouse
navigation, the drag-to-resize panes, and the cache-first speed.

If you like tuistore, you'll probably like the rest of the suite:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [**ltui**](https://github.com/runpantheon/ltui) | a fast, clean TUI for Linear |
| [**jtui**](https://github.com/Gheat1/jtui) | the same, for Jira |
| [**sctui**](https://github.com/Gheat1/sctui) | the same, for Shortcut |
| [**NaviTui**](https://github.com/Gheat1/NaviTui) | an animated terminal player for Navidrome |
| [**opentab**](https://github.com/Gheat1/opentab) | browse your AI coding spend in the terminal |
| [**ricekit**](https://github.com/Gheat1/ricekit) | the design system all of them share |

## config & data

XDG dirs, via ricekit's `AppDirs`:

| what | where |
| --- | --- |
| state (theme, layout) | `~/.local/state/tuistore/state.json` |
| cache (scraped installs) | `~/.cache/tuistore/` |
| the catalog | shipped in the package (`tuistore/data/catalog.json`) |

`tuistore --doctor` prints what your machine looks like to the install engine.

## contributing

Missing a tool, or a better install command? The catalog lives in
`tuistore/data/catalog.json` and is regenerated by `tools/build_catalog.py` —
PRs to add tools, fix install methods, or improve scraping are very welcome.
The awesome-tuis list itself is the upstream source for most entries.
